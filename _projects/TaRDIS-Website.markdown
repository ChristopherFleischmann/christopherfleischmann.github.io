When the robotics team was first started we had to create a way to reach to possible sponsors. One idea was to create
a website completely from scratch to host some of our documents that sponsors could have easy access to. Two people from the marketing created the website and it was launched in October of 2014. Unfortunately, after it was created the website was pushed to the side and mostly forgotten. Around May of 2015 I volunteered to maintain the website, however I quickly learned that it was extremely difficult to make updates or small changes. I also believed that the theme of our website was too plain. So, in the summer of 2015, I redesigned the website to help standardize and establish our brand and enable us to add all the outreach and learning modules our team wished to share with other teams.

The newer website was developed in Adobe Muse® and embedded social media content, a media page for access to photographs and videos, a team calendar to help us communicate and organize across the functional teams, a team store for buying t-shirts and other team branded items, highly visible sponsor logos to help promote our sponsors, and easy access to mentor, student, and sponsor forms. I modeled the website around our business plan in order to maximize the efficiency and design of our new website. We quickly realized that this website became too crowded with information.

The current website was developed because our team wanted to innovate the way our website worked. I started by developing the structural navigation, and selecting a relevant theme to work with. Then I asked some of the marketing team to help actively in building and designing the rest of the website. Thanks to everyones great ideas and constructive criticism we manages to build a website that was beautiful, content efficient and unique.
