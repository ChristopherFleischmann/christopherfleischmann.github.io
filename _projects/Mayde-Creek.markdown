In my senior year, I voluteered to help a nearby high school (Mayde Creek High School) in starting their robotics team. My job is to mentor the students in programming, robot driving, team scouting and web design and development. As of now the team does not have a website nut is currently in the process of building one. The goal of the marketing team is to get one out as soon as possible in order for possible sponsors to learn more about the team.
